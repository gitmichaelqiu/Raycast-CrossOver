Based on the AppleScript terminology provided in the CrossOver PDF, here are several potential commands for your Raycast extension, along with their feasibility and implementation notes:

---

### **1. List All Bottles (Documents)**
**Command:** `list-bottles`  
**Feasibility:** ✅ Possible  
**Implementation:**  
Use the `documents` element of the CrossOver application to retrieve open bottles.  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    get every document
end tell
```
**Notes:**  
- Bottles may be represented as `document` objects. This will return all open bottles.

---

### **2. Open a Bottle**
**Command:** `open-bottle [file-path]`  
**Feasibility:** ✅ Possible  
**Implementation:**  
Use the `open` command to open a `.cxbottle` file (or equivalent).  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    open "/path/to/bottle.cxbottle"
end tell
```
**Notes:**  
- Requires the user to specify the bottle file path. Ensure the file extension matches CrossOver's bottle format.

---

### **3. Close a Bottle**
**Command:** `close-bottle [bottle-name]`  
**Feasibility:** ✅ Possible  
**Implementation:**  
Close a specific document (bottle) by name or index.  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    close document "BottleName"
end tell
```
**Notes:**  
- Supports saving changes via the `saving yes/ask/no` parameter.

---

### **4. Quit CrossOver**
**Command:** `quit-crossover`  
**Feasibility:** ✅ Possible  
**Implementation:**  
Quit the application with optional save prompts.  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    quit saving yes
end tell
```

---

### **5. Check if a Bottle Exists**
**Command:** `bottle-exists [bottle-name]`  
**Feasibility:** ✅ Possible  
**Implementation:**  
Use the `exists` command to verify a bottle is open.  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    exists document "BottleName"
end tell
→ boolean
```

---

### **6. Create a New Bottle**
**Command:** `create-bottle [name]`  
**Feasibility:** ⚠️ Limited  
**Implementation:**  
Use `make` to create a new document (potential bottle).  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    make new document with properties {name:"NewBottle"}
end tell
```
**Notes:**  
- May require additional configuration (e.g., setting paths or properties specific to bottles). The `make` command’s capabilities depend on CrossOver’s scripting support.

---

### **7. Switch to a Bottle Window**
**Command:** `focus-bottle [bottle-name]`  
**Feasibility:** ✅ Possible  
**Implementation:**  
Bring a bottle’s window to the front.  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    set frontmost of window "BottleName" to true
end tell
```

---

### **8. List Running Bottles**

**Command:** `running-bottles`  
**Feasibility:** ✅ Possible  
**Implementation:**  
Filter documents by `modified` status or window visibility.  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    get every document whose modified is true
end tell
```
**Notes:**  
- Adjust criteria based on how CrossOver tracks running bottles (e.g., `visible` windows or `modified` state).

---

### **9. Move/Resize a Bottle Window**

**Command:** `move-bottle [bottle-name] [x,y,width,height]`  
**Feasibility:** ✅ Possible  
**Implementation:**  
Adjust the `bounds` property of the window.  
```applescript
tell application "CrossOver"
    set bounds of window "BottleName" to {x, y, width, height}
end tell
```

---

### **Limitations & Considerations**
- **Bottle-Specific Actions:** CrossOver’s AppleScript terminology does not explicitly expose "bottle" as a class. The `document` class likely represents bottles, but advanced actions (e.g., installing apps inside a bottle) may not be scriptable.
- **Undocumented Features:** Some CrossOver-specific properties (e.g., bottle configurations) may not be accessible via AppleScript unless explicitly documented.
- **UI Automation Fallback:** If AppleScript lacks depth, consider combining it with **System Events** for UI-level automation (e.g., clicking buttons in CrossOver’s interface).

---

### **Example Raycast Extension Workflow**
1. **List Bottles:** Fetch and display all open documents (bottles).
2. **Open Bottle:** Prompt the user to select a `.cxbottle` file.
3. **Close/Quit:** Allow quick closure of bottles or the entire app.
4. **Focus Bottle:** Switch between running bottles via window activation.

By leveraging the standard AppleScript suite, you can build a functional extension, though deeper integration may require CrossOver’s developers to expose additional scripting capabilities.
